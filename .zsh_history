Installation ‚É∫ÉπÔ∏ÉØ\
\
    Fork/Clone/Download this repo\
\
    git clone https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram.git\
\
    Navigate to the directory\
\
    cd Osintgram\
\
    Create a virtual environment for this project\
\
    python3 -m venv venv\
\
    Load the virtual environment\
        On Windows Powershell: .\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1\
        On Linux and Git Bash: source venv/bin/activate\
\
    Run pip install -r requirements.txt\
\
    Open the credentials.ini file in the config folder and write your Instagram account username and password in the corresponding fields\
\
    Alternatively, you can run the make setup command to populate this file for you.\
\
    Run the main.py script in one of two ways\
        As an interactive prompt python3 main.py <target username>\
        Or execute your command straight away python3 main.py <target username> --command <command>\
\
Use Osintgram v2 (beta)\
\
You can use Osintgram2 beta just switching to v2 branch. The v2 has some improvements and is faster with a new command execution interface. Try it just running git checkout v2.\
Docker Quick Start ÉøÉ∞≥\
\
This section will explain how you can quickly use this image with Docker or Docker-compose.\
Prerequisites\
\
Before you can use either Docker or Docker-compose, please ensure you do have the following prerequisites met.\
\
    Docker installed - link\
    Docker-composed installed (if using Docker-compose) - link\
    Credentials configured - This can be done manually or by running the make setup command from the root of this repo\
\
Important: Your container will fail if you do not do step #3 and configure your credentials\
Docker\
\
If docker is installed you can build an image and run this as a container.\
\
Build:\
\
docker build -t osintgram .\
\
Run:\
\
docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD/output:/home/osintgram/output" osintgram <target>\
\
    The <target> is the Instagram account you wish to use as your target for recon.\
    The required -i flag enables an interactive terminal to use commands within the container. docs\
    The required -v flag mounts a volume between your local filesystem and the container to save to the ./output/ folder. docs\
    The optional --rm flag removes the container filesystem on completion to prevent cruft build-up. docs\
    The optional -t flag allocates a pseudo-TTY which allows colored output. docs\
\
Using docker-compose\
\
You can use the docker-compose.yml file this single command:\
\
docker-compose run osintgram <target>\
\
Where target is the Instagram target for recon.\
\
Alternatively, you may run docker-compose with the Makefile:\
\
make run - Builds and Runs with compose. Prompts for a target before running.\
Makefile (easy mode)\
\
For ease of use with Docker-compose, a Makefile has been provided.\
\
Here is a sample work flow to spin up a container and run osintgram with just two commands!\
\
    make setup - Sets up your Instagram credentials\
    make run - Builds and Runs a osintgram container and prompts for a target\
\
Sample workflow for development:\
\
    make setup - Sets up your Instagram credentials\
    make build-run-testing - Builds an Runs a container without invoking the main.py script. Useful for an it Docker session for development\
    make cleanup-testing - Cleans up the testing container created from build-run-testing\
\
